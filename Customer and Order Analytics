## In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#Q1# How many orders were placed in January? 

Select count(orderid)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where orderid <> 'Order ID'

#Q2# How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

Select count(Product)
From BIT_DB.JanSales

#Q4# Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

Select distinct product, price

Group by Product;

#Q7# How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

Select count(distinct cus.acctnum) as Total_customers,
Round(avg(quantity*price),2) as Total_customers
