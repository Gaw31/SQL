## In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#Q1# How many orders were placed in January? 

Select count(orderid)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where orderid <> 'Order ID'
And length(orderid) = 6;

#Q2# How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

Select count(Product)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where Product = 'iPhone';

#Q3# Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

Select * 
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Where orderid <> 'Order ID'
And length(orderid) = 6;

#Q4# Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

Select distinct product, price 
From BIT_DB.JanSales 
Order by price asc
limit 1;

#Q5#  What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

Select Distinct Product, Round(SUM(Price), 2) as Total_price
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where orderid <> 'Order ID'
And length(orderid) = 6
Group by Product
Order By Total_price desc;

#Q6# Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

Select Product, Sum(Quantity) as Total_Quality,
Sum(Quantity)*Price as Revenue
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group by Product;

#Q7# How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

Select count(distinct cus.acctnum) as Total_customers,
Round(avg(quantity*price),2) as Total_customers
From BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
Left Join BIT_DB.customers as cus
On FEB.orderid=cus.order_id
Where Feb.Quantity>2
And length(orderid) = 6
And orderid <> 'Order ID';
